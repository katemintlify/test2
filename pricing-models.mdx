## Standard pricing

Charge a fixed recurring or one-time fee.

<Card title="Example">
$10 per month or $500 implementation fee
</Card>

Examples: [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)

---

## Linear pricing
Charge a uniform rate for all usage events.

<Card title="Example">
 - $0.1 per unit
 - 550 units = $55.00
</Card>

Examples: [OpenAI - GPT-3 Davinci](https://openai.com/pricing/)

---

## Volume pricing

Offer volume discounts for higher usage and an optional flat fee per usage tier. Customers only pay the unit and flat fee in their current tier.

<Card title="Example">
- Tier 1: 0 - 100 units @ 1$/unit + $20 flat fee 
- Tier 2: 100 - ∞ units @ $0.75/unit + $50 flat fee

Calculation for 125 units: 125 * $0.75 + $50 = $143.75
</Card>

Examples: [Twilio - SMS](https://www.twilio.com/sms/pricing/)

## Volume pricing (Percentage-based)

Similar to standard volume tiers, but the unit price is a percentage of a sum (e.g., total transactions). Customers only pay the percentage and flat fee in their current tier.

<Card title="Example">
- Tier 1: 0 - $10000 @ 0.1% +$500 flat fee
- Tier 2: $10000- ∞ @ 0.05% + $250 flat fee

Calculation for $15000 Transaction volume: $15000 * 0.05% + $250 = $325
</Card>

Examples: [Stripe - Payments](https://stripe.com/pricing)



## Graduated pricing

Charge multiple rates for multiple tiers (similar to progressive income tax), with an optional flat fee per tier. Tiers and flat fees accumulate.

<Card title="Example">
- Tier 1: 0 - 100 units @ 1$/unit + $20 flat fee
- Tier 2: 100 - ∞ units @ $0.75/unit + $50 flat fee

Calculation for 125 units: 100 * $1 + $20 + 25 * $0.75 + $50 = $188.75
</Card>

Examples: [Amazon Web Services - S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/)


## Graduated pricing /(Percentage-based/)

Similar to standard graduated tiers, but the unit price is a percentage of a sum (e.g., total transactions). Tiers and flat fees accumulate.

<Card title="Example">
- Tier 1: 0 - $10000 @ 0.1% +$500 flat fee
- Tier 2: $10000 - ∞ @ 0.05% + $250 flat fee

Calculation for $15000 Transaction volume: $10000 * 0.1% + $500 + $5000 * 0.05% + $250 = $875
</Card>



## Packaged pricing

Charge a fixed price for a package of units (similar to linear rate but with packaged quantities). Also known as stair-step pricing.

<Card title="Example">
Pricing: $10 per 250 units
Calculation for 600 units: 3 Packages * $10 = $30
</Card>
