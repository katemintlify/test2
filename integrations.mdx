title: "Integrate with Snyk"
---

Snyk integrates with many languages, platforms, and systems, including:

* [**Git repository (SCM) integrations**](/integrations/git-repository-scm-integrations), such as GitHub, to connect your code repo to Snyk, and use Snyk's facilities to automatically generate PRs for package upgrades to fix vulnerabilities.

* [**IDEs**](/integrations/ide-tools), such as Visual Studio, to integrate Snyk plugins or extensions fully in your development environment.

* [**CI/CD integrations**](/integrations/ci-cd-integrations), such as Circle CI. Many users start with these integrations; also check the information on [setting up](/integrations/ci-cd-integrations#setting-up) and [configuring Snyk integrations](/integrations/ci-cd-integrations#configure-your-continuous-integration).

* [**Notification and ticketing systems**](/integrations/notifications-ticketing-system-integrations), such as Slack or Jira, to provide notifications about new vulnerabilities that affect your projects and about new upgrades or patches that have become available.

* [**Vulnerability management tools**](/integrations/vulnerability-management-tools)**,** such as RiskSense, to incorporate your software composition analysis (SCA) data with your application risk management solution.

* [**Private registry gatekeeper plugins**](/integrations/private-registry-gatekeeper-plugins) and [**private registry integrations**](/integrations/private-registry-integrations), such as Artifactory, to scan your artifacts for open source vulnerabilities and license issues.

* [**Serverless integrations**](/integrations/serverless-integrations), such as Azure functions, letting you monitor deployed code for any known vulnerabilities found in the application's dependencies, testing at a frequency you control.

* [**Platform as a Service integrations**](/integrations/platform-as-a-service-integrations), such as Heroku. See [Platform as a service integrations](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/platform-as-a-service-integrations).
