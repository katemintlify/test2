Snyk goes beyond finding vulnerabilities and license compliance issues. Our priority scoring, reporting, and policy setting capabilities help you prioritize and fix the most critical issues first.

### Use priority scoring

The [Snyk Priority Score](/manage-issues/issue-management/priority-score) prioritizes issues based on a number of industry-standard criteria, including Kubernetes configuration data and signals from running containers.

### Apply project attributes

Control prioritization at a granular level by applying [project attributes](/manage-issues/introduction-to-snyk-projects/project-attributes) such as:

* Lifecycle stage

* Business criticality

* Environment

### Organize issues

Snyk [reporting](https://github.com/snyk/user-docs/blob/main/docs/features/fixing-and-prioritizing-issues/broken-reference/README.md) keeps you up to date on the status of the issues, dependencies, and licenses you need, while letting you [ignore the issues](/manage-issues/issue-management/ignore-issues) you don’t.

### Assess reachability

Gauge risk by identifying whether a vulnerable function is being called by your application, with Snyk’s [reachable vulnerability](/manage-issues/issue-management/reachable-vulnerabilities) scanning.

### Set security policies

Prioritize or de-prioritize specific vulnerabilities automatically with our customizable [security policies](/manage-issues/security-policies).

### Fix the issues

After you decide issue priority, it's time to start [fixing the vulnerabilities](/manage-issues/starting-to-fix-vulnerabilities).

Snyk can generate automatic PRs for upgrades and suggest recommended fixes. See [Fix your vulnerabilities](/manage-issues/starting-to-fix-vulnerabilities/fix-your-vulnerabilities) for more information on how Snyk helps you maintain code security through patches and direct dependency upgrades.
