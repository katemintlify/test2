With Snyk, you can secure cloud infrastructure before and after it is deployed. [Snyk Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](/scan-cloud-deployment/snyk-infrastructure-as-code) enables you to develop secure cloud infrastructure, and [Snyk Cloud](/scan-cloud-deployment/snyk-cloud) helps you keep your cloud environment secure.

* Scan [IaC](/scan-cloud-deployment/snyk-infrastructure-as-code) and [cloud](/scan-cloud-deployment/snyk-cloud) resources for misconfigurations using a comprehensive set of security rules.

* Receive [fix advice](/scan-cloud-deployment/snyk-infrastructure-as-code/getting-started-snyk-iac) so you can make changes directly to code, before applications reach production.

* Suppress false positives in IaC tests by applying [context from deployed infrastructure](/scan-cloud-deployment/snyk-infrastructure-as-code/integrated-infrastructure-as-code/adding-cloud-context-to-your-iac-test).

* [Detect drift](/scan-cloud-deployment/snyk-infrastructure-as-code/detect-drift-and-manually-created-resources) and manually created resources in your cloud.

* Inspect every [cloud resource's configuration](/scan-cloud-deployment/snyk-cloud/snyk-cloud-issues/view-cloud-issues-in-the-snyk-web-ui) at a given moment in time, and see the attributes that caused an issue.

* [Filter issues](/scan-cloud-deployment/snyk-cloud/snyk-cloud-issues) to target the most mission-critical resources.

* Review a [report of issues](/manage-issues/snyk-reports/reporting-beta-2022/available-snyk-reports#cloud-compliance-issues-report) for an entire organization, organized by compliance standard.
