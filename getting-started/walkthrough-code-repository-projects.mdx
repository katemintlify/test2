## Introduction

This walkthrough shows how to use Snyk to scan, manage and fix application vulnerabilities in your Git-based code repository, using the [Snyk Web UI](/getting-started/getting-started-with-the-snyk-web-ui).

This walkthrough uses content imported from a GitHub repository. Snyk also supports other common Git-based repositories (such as GitLab and Azure), and items from all these repositories can be added to be scanned. See [Git repository integrations](/integrations/git-repository-scm-integrations) for more details.

For general guidance about rolling out your Snyk solution to your teams, see Implementing Snyk: Free and Team plan users, or Implementing Snyk: Enterprise plan users.

### Prerequisites

This walkthrough assumes that you have followed the initial setup steps as described in the [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart) documentation (first [create a Snyk account](/getting-started/quickstart/create-a-snyk-account), then [set up an integration](/getting-started/quickstart/set-up-an-integration) with a Git repo, and then [import a Project](/getting-started/quickstart/import-a-project) containing items for scanning).

### First step: see your projects

Let's start by [viewing your first project](/getting-started/walkthrough-code-repository-projects/view-your-first-snyk-projects).
