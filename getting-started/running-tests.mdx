## Introduction to running Snyk tests

You can use Snyk to test your code in different ways:

* [Run tests manually](/getting-started/running-tests#run-tests-manually): using the Snyk CLI, the Snyk Web UI, and the Snyk API

* [Run tests automatically](/getting-started/running-tests#run-tests-automatically): after Project import, using the `snyk monitor` CLI command, or using PR Checks to scan new PRs

Tests may be limited on your account; see [What counts as a test?](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360000925418-What-counts-as-a-test-) for more information.

## Run tests manually

### Run tests manually with the CLI

With the Snyk [CLI](/snyk-cli/cli-reference) you can use the following commands:

* Scan open-source code with `snyk test`.

* Scan application code with `snyk code test`.

* Scan container images with `snyk container test`.

* Scan Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files with `snyk iac test`.

See [Getting started with the CLI](/snyk-cli/getting-started-with-the-cli) for details.

### Run tests manually with the Snyk Web UI

A test is run when you import a Snyk Project (see [Import a Project](/getting-started/quickstart/import-a-project)), or click the **Retest now** button on a Project in the Overview tab.

See [Exploring the Snyk Web UI](/getting-started/getting-started-with-the-snyk-web-ui) for details.

### Run tests manually with the API

Tests are counted when calls are made to the **https://snyk.io/api/v1/test** endpoint.

See the [API documentation](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/test) for details.

## Run tests automatically

### Run tests automatically with the Snyk Web UI

After you [import a Project](/getting-started/quickstart/import-a-project), Snyk automatically runs periodic scans on that Project, to see if your code is affected by newly disclosed vulnerabilities.

Test frequency is set to daily by default. To change frequency, go to the **Usage** page (see [Usage page details](/user-and-group-management/managing-settings/usage-page-details)), the project **Settings** page (see [View project settings](/manage-issues/introduction-to-snyk-projects/view-project-settings)) or use the Snyk REST API: [Updates project by project ID](https://apidocs.snyk.io/?version=2023-02-15#patch-/orgs/-org%5Fid-/projects/-project%5Fid-).

### Run tests automatically with snyk monitor

Use the `snyk monitor` CLI command to create a snapshot of a project on the Snyk website that will be continuously monitored for new vulnerabilities.

See [Monitor your projects at regular intervals](/snyk-cli/test-for-vulnerabilities/monitor-your-projects-at-regular-intervals) for details.

### Run tests automatically using PR Checks

Snyk can scan every new Pull Request (PR) submitted on your monitored repositories, to help prevent new vulnerabilities from being added to your codebase.

See [Run PR Checks](/scan-application-code/run-pr-checks) for details.
